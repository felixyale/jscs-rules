## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

How to use
----------------------------

```bash
git clone git://github.com/felixyale/jscs-rules.git
```

Enter the base directory and run the build script:

```bash
cd jscs-rules && npm install
```

Once packages has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of script:

```js
grunt
```
